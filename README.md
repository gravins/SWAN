## Run the experiments
To reproduce the experiments please refer to:

[graph_property_prediction/README.md](https://github.com/gravins/SWAN/tree/main/graph_property_prediction) to run the diameter, SSSP, and eccentricity experiments.
[graph_transfer/README.md](https://github.com/gravins/SWAN/tree/main/graph_transfer) to run the graph transfer tasks on line, ring, and crossed-ring topologies.
